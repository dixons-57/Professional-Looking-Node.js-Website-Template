# Professional-Looking Node.js Website Template
 A Node.js based program that acts as a server, and hosts a professional-looking website. Uses AJAX to seamlessly load content in the client's browser without page changes. Also uses a responsive UI to be mobile friendly, using pure CSS. Ideal for a personal website or CV.

To get up and running, do the following

1) Install Node.js to your PC using whatever method is relevant for your OS.
2) Navigate to the directory containing server.js.
3) Use Node Package Manager (npm tool which comes with Node.js) to install "express", so that the folder /node_modules/express is created.
4) Run the server using the command "sudo node server.js" in Linux, or "node server" in Windows.
5) Enter "localhost" into your favourite browser.
